Peer-2-peer screensharing and chat in the browser...

## 👇🏻 Introduction :

Backed by no server, runs entirely in the browser to chat and screenshare with a peer. It supports both mobile and desktop (screen capture may not be available on mobile). I Made this app Just to try out Vue 3.

## 💎Features :

   
(1): It has Peer-2-Peer Screensharing option, You can seamlessly share your real time Screen to other 
     Person ! I tried to Maintain the Quality of Sharing :) and Optimized the chat speed to good level.

(2): You can Create Unlimited Rooms !!

(3): One of the Most Demanding and Unique Feature is, You Need not to Create Any type of Accounts to Use StreamitUP ! 
     In Short This is Account-less !!
              
(4): Easy Pairing between Host-2-User :p

(5): User friendly UI, I tried to Make it Simpler and Easy to use!!

(6): Responsive Layout, Compatible on any devices you use,


## 🤔 How to use :

The app is available [👉🏻here👈🏻](https://streamitup.vercel.app/).

Once you have opened it on your browser, you can create a room, choose a username and share the room's link with the person you'd like to chat/screenshare with.

Screensharing is optional, you may start streaming at any time, stop streaming, change the window/screen that you're sharing. Audio capture may not be available, depending on browser.

❗ **Note** : ```If in Case Your Mobile browser, Says- "The Screen Capture is not supported by your browser" ! You need not to worry about this, but you can Try *Edge* or Any Screensharing supported browser which is compatible on your Device.```
